**About this project**

--> This is a project in progress. <--

Check out the app [here](https://susi189.github.io/react-charting-app/).

I created this Charting App based on a [Creighton Model FertilityCare System](https://creightonmodel.com/background/) which is a physical paper chart for recording observations during menstrual cycle. The observations are color coded and there is a recording system based on numbers and letters.

_Technical overview_

React Framework was my choice here mostly for learning purposes, and I quickly realized the advantage of using this framework opposed to building it with plain JavaScript.

To be able to store the data I used Supabase (Backend-as-a-Service model), specifically for it's easy set up. It is great for someone who has little to no knowledge about the back-end.

_What have I learned (so far)?_

- All the React fundamentals (components, states and parent-child communication)
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- React Context
- Using Forms
- Date Object in JavaScript
- Connecting the app via API to an external service
- Making sure not to push the API key to a Github repository ;)
